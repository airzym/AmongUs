## Crewmate

Crewmates have a list of tasks they have to complete, if all crewmates complete their tasks they win.

**If a crewmate dies they still need to complete their tasks**

## Imposter

Kill everyone.

## Visible tasks

Visible tasks are tasks that can be seen by another player to verify that the person on the task is innocent. An imposter should avoid trying to do these. The exception is for Shields on The Skeld, as once these have been turned on the first time, these will stay on.

### The Skeld

4 visible tasks: medbay scanner, turrets in weapons and rubbish shoot in storage which will always be visable. As well as shields which will only be visable the first time someone does it.

### Mira HQ

1 visible task: medbay scanner.

### Polus

2 visible tasks: medbay scanner and turrets

## Common Tasks

Common tasks are tasks everyone will have. If players start doing these tasks then everyone will have them. This is important for the imposters to know as if they see everyone doing a common task, they should join in. On the flip side, if the crew see someone doing a common task when they themselves don't have the common task, then they will likely be the imposter.

### The Skeld

2 Common tasks: Fix Wiring and Swipe Card

### Mira HQ

2 Common tasks: Fix Wiring and Enter ID Code

### Polus

4 Common tasks: Fix Wiring, Scan Boarding Pass, Swipe Card and Scan Boarding Pass

## Vents

Vents can only be used by imposters, if you see someone jump in or out of one they are definitely an imposter.

### Skeld

The vents from electrical goes to medbay and security.
Vent from shields goes to the lower one in nav.
Vent from weapons goes to the upper one in nav.
Vent from cafeteria goes to admin and corridor near nav.

### Mira HQ

all vents go to all other vents.

### Polus
On Polus, one of them goes from the wall just outside of admin to admin all the way up to outside the south wall of lab to the toilets in lab.
Another goes from storage to the corridor below left office to somewhere outside above weapons/below communications.
The last set go from left side reactor to right side reactor (so just either side of the dropship)

## Emergency button

This is the big button in cafeteria, it calls a meeting so everyone can chat.
This can be used by each player **one** time.
If you see something suspicious like someone venting you can press this button and tell everyone what you saw.
Pressing the button will also reset the imposters kill cool down.

## Special activities

activities anyone can do on each map

### The Skeld

In the admin room you can approach the left side of the table at which point you will get a prompt to use the table, this will show you a map of how many people are in each room. It only shows rooms so will not show you people is in corridors. This is can be useful to use because if someone hasn't left a room for a long time it might be because they are dead, so you can go and check up on them.

In the security room you can approach the security cameras and view them. There are 4 of them dotted around the map.
Outside nav, outside admin outside the security room and one outside medbay.

There cameras will have a red light flash on them if they are in use, so imposters should pay attention to if someone is watching when they make a kill.
Cameras will see everything fully even when the lights are out.

### Mira HQ

In the Admin room, you can approach the large table in the middle. This is the same as the Admin table in The Skeld.

In the Communications room, there is a monitor on the top right. If you view this, you can view the sensor logs. Each time a player passes into or out of the Y-shaped corridor (at the points where flooring changes to/from a glass floor) there is a sensor. You can see if you have passed it as when you pass over it the sensor will flash.

You can use the sensors to question people's pathing. If for example, you see a player in Reactor and you leave but they stay. If you check the logs and see that player pass the North sensor, without first passing the South West sensor, then you know the likelihood is that this person vented across - so this can be used to the crewmates advantage. There is a 5 second cooldown on each sensor, so if two people cross them at the same time, or one shortly after the other, it may only log one person passing through. The imposter can use this to their advantage.

The logs only show the last 20 triggers, but they do persist from round to round.

### Polus

In the Admin room, you can approach either side of the table above the decontamination and this shows the same information as the other Admin tables.

In the right-side Office room, you can approach the right-hand monitor which will show you the vitals of each player. Any player alive with display a green "OK" vital line. Any player who dies within the round (between meetings) will display in red as "DEAD" if someone appears as "DEAD" you know they've been killed since the last time everyone discussed. If a player died in a previous round (before the last meeting) they will display in black with the text "D/C".

In the Security room, there is a wall of cameras. You can only view one camera at once. There are 4 in total - outside lab, outside electrical, outside left office, outside right office.

As with the cameras on The Skeld, they will see everything fully even when the lights are out.

## Sabotages

Along with killing and vents, Sabotages are one of the most important aspects of being a good imposter. Whilst a Sabotage is in progress, an emergency meeting can't be called (an exception to this are doors, which are just allow the imposters to separate people). Imposters can call Sabotages from anywhere on the map from their Sabotage map, and they are able to interact and fix the Sabotages to try and avoid suspicion. All Sabotages (excluding doors) share a cooldown so one sabotage cannot be called immediately after another. Doors have their own individual cooldown, so all doors can be closed as and when the imposter would like, but that door will have a cooldown once it has reopened.

### Reactor Meltdown

Every level has a reactor. When the reactor meltdown is called, the players have 45 seconds to reach the reactor and disable it. Disabling a reactor requires 2 players - one on each side. On all maps, this task is a hand scanner, where you just need to click and hold the hand print until someone else presses the other one. This can be used by the imposters to draw crewmates away from where bodies are if the imposters chooses to kill at the opposite side.

### Disable Comms

Every level has the ability to disable Comms as well. In The Skeld and Polus, this is the same. This will display as a radio and you have to turn the dial to make the radio frequency on the right hand side of the dial the same as the left hand side. On Mira HQ, there are two tables to fix Comms. Each table as a device with a code on it and a keypad. The code on the device has to be entered into the keypad. The device code will reset after a short amount of time. Both of these have to be done in quick succession of each other to turn Comms back on.

Whilst Comms are disabled, crewmates won't be able to see where their tasks are on their map, they won't be able to view security cameras/sensor logs, the admin table, vitals or call an emergency meeting.

### Lights

Every level has lights as well. When lights are down, crewmates will have a much more limited field of view. Imposters won't be affected by this. This makes it more difficult for the crewmates to see any potential kills, even ones close by. Lights need to be fixed in Electrical in The Skeld and Polus, and in Office in Mira HQ. To fix lights there will be a series of switches and all of them need to be flicked on (green light on)

### O2

O2 is only available on The Skeld and Mira HQ. This works similarly to reactor. You have 45 seconds to fix the O2 before the crew lose the game. Unlike reactor, the O2 tasks are in different areas of the map and can be used by the imposters to separate the crewmates. The O2 task appears as a code that needs to be entered from a card.

### Doors

Doors are only available in The Skeld and Polus. In The Skeld, when doors are closed they will reopen on a timer. In Polus, the doors need to be opened manually by flicking all of the switches to the same side (the lighter red side).

## Hide and Seek Rules

Hide & Seek is a different rule set. There is only 1 imposter. The imposter vision is reduced down to 0.25x and the crewmate vision is increased to 5x. This means the crew will have maximum vision but the imposter won't be able to see anything. The tasks will all be short and number of tasks and the kill cooldown will be adjusted for the number of players.

At the start of the game, the imposter needs to wait until they can disable comms before moving. Crewmates can't fix comms until they know there are only 4 players left. Once comms are fixed, no other sabotages can be called.

The goal is for the 1 imposter to kill all crewmates before the crewmates complete all of their tasks. These are the only two ways to win.
Crewmates can report bodies to check to see how many people are left but voting must be skipped, and can also report to reset the kill cooldown. Imposters can also report bodies to reset everyone back to spawn if they lose track.

Unlike the standard game, mics don't need to be muted and the imposter can tell people that they're the imposter, as can the crew. Dead players shouldn't warn other players about where the imposter is.
